// The behaviors package provides several generic and always
// useful standard behaviors for the Tideland Go Cell Network.
// They are simply created with NewXyzBehavior(). The configuration
// is done by constructor arguments. Additionally some of them take
// functions or implementations of interfaces to control their
// processing.
//
// The behaviors are:
//
// - the broadcaster behavior simply emits all received events to all
//   subscribers;
// - the collector behavior collects all received events and also emits
//   them, they can be retrieved and resetted;
// - the counter behavior increments and emits counters identified by
//   the return value of a configurable function and the individual events,
//   the counters can be retrieved and resetted;
// - the filter behavior is created with a filtering function which is
//   called for each event, when it returns true the event is emitted;
// - the FSM behavior implements a finite state machine, state functions
//   process the events and return the following state;
// - the logger behavior logs every event at info level;
// - the mapper behavior is created with a mapping function processing
//   each event and returning a new mapped one;
// - the round robin behavior distributes each received event round robin
//   to its subscribers;
// - the ticker behavior emits a tick event in a defined interval to its
//   subscribers.
